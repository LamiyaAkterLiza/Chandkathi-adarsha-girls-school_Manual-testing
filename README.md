# Chandkathi Adarsha Girls' Secondary School – Manual Testing 
## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains **manual software testing artifacts** for the [https://caghschool.edu.bd/]. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate structured **Quality Assurance (QA)** practices through well-documented testing deliverables.

The repository focuses on validating **functional correctness**, **usability**, and **system reliability** using standard manual testing techniques.

---

## 🎯 Test Objectives
- Verify that functional requirements are implemented correctly
- Identify defects through structured manual testing
- Assess system usability and user interaction flows
- Ensure traceability between test conditions and test cases
- Produce clear and reviewable test documentation

---

## 🧪 Scope of Testing
### In Scope
- Functional testing of core system features
- User interface and usability validation
- Basic regression testing of previously tested functionality

### Out of Scope
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Automation testing

---

## 📂 Testware 
The repository includes the following **testware** artifacts:

- **Test Plan**  
  Defines test objectives, scope, approach, entry/exit criteria, and assumptions.

- **Test Scenarios / Test Conditions**  
  High-level conditions derived from functional requirements.

- **Test Cases**  
  Detailed, step-by-step test procedures mapped to test conditions.

- **Defect Reports**  
  Logged defects with severity, expected result, actual result, and status.

- **Test Summary Report**  
  Overview of test execution results, defect statistics, and overall quality assessment.
